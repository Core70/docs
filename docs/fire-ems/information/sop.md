# Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

 ### Mission Statement
The mission of the San Andreas Fire Department is to serve and provide the best services available for the citizens of San Andreas by being professional and undergoing the best training possible. 

### Chain of Command

The San Andreas Fire Department operates on a Chain of Comamnd, or COC. The chain of command starts at Recruit, going all the way up to Fire Chief. All members of the SAFD must follow the CoC. If any questions need to be answered, everyone must go to their immediate Supervisor. The first rank in the coc is Lieutenant. If a Lieutenant can't answer a question. they will go to a Captain, and then to Battallion Chief, and so on. Failing to follow CoC can result in punishment. In the event there is no Command Members on duty, the highest ranking and longest tenured member on duty will act in a command capacity to ensure order. 


### Start of Shift

When starting your shift, it is always important to inspect the apparatus you are assigned to. This includes but is not limited to, checking tire pressure, equipment, gas level, oil level, sirens, lights, and headlights. You can do /e clipboard while doing this checklist. Before going in service, always fill up your apparatus with gas to ensure you can respond to calls without running out of gas. After finishing your checklist, file it in reception. 



### Radio Communications

The San Andreas Fire Department does not use 10 codes in communications. We always talk plainly. For example when we are arriving on a scene, we say "Engine 22 arriving on scene of structure fire at 3000 East Joshua Rd." When needing to communicate with others, We do Hey you, its me. For example "90-10 90-05 where is your location?" We communicate this way so there is no confusion on scenes as fires and medical situations can quickly evolve and its always best to communicate fast and efficiently. Unless otherwise told, we always operate on channel 155. 


### Apparatus Assignment

All units can operate any apparatus unless otherwise told by the highest in command during patrol. Anyone assigned to special apparatus's such as rescue or brush will be assigned to the district engine unless needed on a call. All members should use their best judgement when alone on what apparatus's to have out during patrol. No one should be responding to a structure fire in a brush or a rescue engine. Most fires should be responded to in a district engine, and when necessary, arial or brush. All car accidents should be responded to with the district engine, with rescue being called in only when necessary. Always respond with an Ambulance to all calls when possible incase of injury to firefighters or citizens.


### Responding to Calls

When responding to calls, always clear intersections, using sirens and horn. to ensure all cars know you are coming. Enroute to the call, try to ask for as much information from dispatch as possible if dispatch is available so that you can be as prepared when arriving on scene as possible. In the event of shootings, always stage a block away and wait for LEO approval to go the scene. This is to ensure the safety of all first responders by making sure the scene is clear for entry by fire and medical.
